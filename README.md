# VolumeControllerUsingHandsGestures
Artificial Intelligence semester project in Python which adjust the system's volume using hand's gestures.
<br>
# Adjust the volume level according to the distance between the Thumb's tip and the Forefinger's tip.
<br>
# LadyFinger plays an important role in adjusting the volume as it works as a indicator just like a button to set the volume whenever it goes down.
